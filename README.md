#  Smart Home Lighting System (Arduino Uno + IoT)

##  Overview
This project demonstrates a **Smart Home Lighting System** built using an **Arduino Uno**.  
The system allows lights to be controlled automatically using sensors (motion/LDR) or manually via a dashboard.

---

## Features
- Automatic light control based on motion detection (PIR sensor)  
- Brightness adjustment using LDR (light sensor)  
- Manual ON/OFF control through switches or dashboard  
- Extendable for IoT-based remote control

## Folder Structure
- `code/` → Arduino programs  
- `web-dashboard/` → Optional web app for remote control  
- `docs/` → Circuit diagram, block diagram, demo setup images  

---

## Applications
- Smart homes and offices  
- Energy-efficient lighting in classrooms  
- Motion-triggered lighting in corridors or parking
